    "In `covidvu.predict` we apply the [logistic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) to model the spread of COVID-19 cases in a given population. Briefly, the logistic equation describes the dynamics of a species (coronavirus) which is under the influence of two competing effects: population expansion through pure birth, and competition for resources causing over-crowding. We represent these dynamics mathematically with the following differential equation:\n",
